## QUERIES




## 1.	Count the customers with grades above Bangalore’s average.
   
```sql

SELECT COUNT(CUSTOMER_ID) AS CUSTOMER_COUNT
FROM CUSTOMER1
WHERE GRADE> (SELECT AVG(GRADE)
FROM CUSTOMER1
WHERE CITY='BANGALORE');



```

## 2.	Find the name and numbers of all salesmen who had more than one customer.
   
```sql
SELECT S.SALESMAN_ID, S.NAME
FROM SALESMAN S, CUSTOMER1 C
WHERE C.SALESMAN_ID=S.SALESMAN_ID
GROUP BY C.SALESMAN_ID HAVING COUNT(C.CUSTOMER_ID)>1;


```


## 3.	List all salesmen and indicate those who have and don’t have customers in their cities (Use UNION operation.)



```sql
SELECT DISTINCT SALESMAN.SALESMAN_ID, NAME, CUST_NAME, COMMISSION
FROM SALESMAN, CUSTOMER1
WHERE SALESMAN.CITY = CUSTOMER1.CITY AND SALESMAN.SALESMAN_ID= CUSTOMER1.SALESMAN_ID
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT SALESMAN.SALESMAN_ID, NAME,'NO_CUSTOMER', COMMISSION
FROM SALESMAN
WHERE NOT CITY=ANY(SELECT CITY FROM CUSTOMER WHERE SALESMAN.CITY = CUSTOMER1.CITY AND SALESMAN.SALESMAN_ID= CUSTOMER.SALESMAN_ID);

```

## 4.	Create a view that finds the salesman who has the customer with the highest order of a day.
   
```sql
4.	Create a view that finds the salesman who has the customer with the highest order of a day.

CREATE VIEW HIGHEST AS SELECT ORDERS.ORD_DATE, SALESMAN.SALESMAN_ID,SALESMAN.NAME, ORDERS.PURCHASE_AMT FROM ORDERS, SALESMAN WHERE SALESMAN.SALESMAN_ID=ORDERS.SALESMAN_ID GROUP BY ORD_DATE HAVING MAX(PURCHASE_AMT);
```
# OR
```sql

CREATE VIEW HIGHEST AS SELECT S.SALESMAN_ID,  NAME, ORD_DATE,PURCHASE_AMT, CITY  FROM ORDERS B, SALESMAN S   WHERE    S.SALESMAN_ID=B.SALESMAN_ID  AND B.PURCHASE_AMT=(SELECT MAX(E.PURCHASE_AMT) FROM ORDERS E WHERE B.ORD_DATE=E.ORD_DATE);


```
# 5.	Demonstrate the DELETE operation by removing salesman with id 1000. All his orders must also be deleted.
```sql
DELETE FROM SALESMAN 
WHERE SALESMAN_ID=1000;


```
